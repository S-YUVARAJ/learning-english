## Issues

Issues can be used to report bugs, typos, request features, or ask questions.

Before opening an issue, please check to make sure someone hasn't already opened an issue about it.

## Pull Requests

Before you start working on an issue, please comment on the issue and wait for it to be assigned to you. This is to avoid multiple people working on the same issue.

Once you have been assigned an issue, you can start working on it. When you are ready to submit your changes, open a pull request.
For a detailed pull request tutorial, see [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github).

Please make sure your Pull Request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Use the PR template provided.
- Keep your Pull Request title succinct, detailed and to the point.
- Keep commits atomic. One commit should contain one change. If you want to make multiple changes, submit multiple Pull Requests.
- Commits should be clear, concise and easy to understand.
- References to the Issue number in the Pull Request and/or Commit message.

### To add new words and phrases

- Add the new word in the file: `src/data/words.ts`, keeping alphabetical order.
- Add the word's phrase and translation to pt-BR in `src/data/contents.ts`.
- Add the word's image in `public/images/[initial_letter]/[word].png`.

> Please keep the alphabetical order in both files, it helps with organization
